 Under Water is a 2D survival-based diving game in which players take on the role of DeepSea Salvage Corporation's new recruit. As a diver, your goal is to explore uncharted underwater caves, collect valuable items, and meet the company's strict quota. Failure to meet these quotas, on the other hand, will result in a grim fate for the diver, who will be barred from resurfacing and will die.
